Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Spy is a command-driven utility for validating, inspecting, and
   analyzing SPK files.
 
 
Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Spy enables SPICE users to perform detailed inspections of the contents
   of binary SPK files in several ways:
 
       --   Sampling evaluated ephemeris data as a time series
 
       --   Dumping specified portions of an SPK file's contents
 
       --   Finding times when specified geometric criteria are satisfied
            by an ephemeris
 
       --   Checking sampled ephemeris data for excursions beyond specified
            value ranges
 
       --   Checking SPK file structure and low-level semantic validity
 
   Spy's user interface is implemented in standard Fortran 77, so all
   inputs and outputs are text-oriented. Spy is controlled via a command
   language; users enter commands at the Spy prompt. Optionally commands
   may be supplied via command file. By default, Spy writes results to the
   standard output stream. Optionally results may be captured in a
   specified ``save'' file. Spy also records in a log file the user
   commands issued during an interactive or batch session.
 
 
Spy Command Set
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The principal Spy command set consists of the following:
 
      SAMPLE command --- sample evaluated ephemeris data
      DUMP command --- display SPK contents
      FIND command --- find times when geometric constraints are met
      CHECK command --- perform semantic checks on files or data
 
   To support the above, the following additional commands control and
   display program settings:
 
      LOAD command --- load SPICE kernels
      UNLOAD command --- unload SPICE kernels
      SET command --- set defaults
      RESET command --- restore original settings of defaults
      SHOW command --- show defaults
 
   Finally, there are commands that control starting, stopping, logging,
   and assist with command entry:
 
      DEFINE command --- define a symbol
      DISCARD command --- close file opened by SAVE TO
      DO command --- repeat a previous command
      ECHO command --- show translated symbols
      EDIT command --- edit a previous command
      EXIT command --- exit the program
      HELP command --- display this text
      NO ECHO command --- disable echoing
      RECALL command--- show command history
      SAVE TO command --- save results to a file
      SET EDITOR command --- specify a command editor
      SHOW SYMBOL command --- show symbol definitions
      START command --- execute a command file
      UNDEFINE command --- delete a symbol definition
 
 
Command Language Basics
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Command Syntax
 
       --   Words in commands must be separated by blanks.
 
       --   Each command must end with a semicolon (except when running Spy
            in command-line mode).
 
       --   Commands can be continued across multiple lines. No
            continuation character is needed; just hit one carriage return
            and continue typing.
 
       --   In a continued command, leaving a line entirely blank causes
            the command to be discarded.
 
       --   Commands are case-insensitive, except for file names and time
            format tokens.
 
 
Symbols
 
   Use symbols to abbreviate words or commands. The syntax is
 
      DEFINE <symbol> <meaning>;
 
   for example,
 
      DEFINE QUIT EXIT;
      DEFINE ABCORR ABERRATION CORRECTION;
 
   Symbols are evaluated recursively, for example:
 
      DEFINE COORDS COORDINATES;
      DEFINE LAT LATITUDINAL;
      DEFINE LATSAM SAMPLE STATES COORDS LAT;
 
   Symbols may not be used to override built-in commands such as DEFINE.
 
   Use
 
      SHOW SYMBOL <symbol>;
 
   to see the translation of a specific symbol; use
 
      SHOW SYMBOL *;
 
   to see all symbol translations.
 
   Use
 
      UNDEFINE <symbol>;
 
   to delete a user-defined symbol.
 
 
Command files
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   You can create Spy ``command files'' by placing in a text file the same
   commands you'd normally execute interactively. Use command files to
   conveniently collect and execute groups of commands. For instance, a
   start-up command file is helpful for loading leapseconds kernels and
   defining your commonly used symbols.
 
   Command file comments are started with semicolons.
 
   In this document we'll use the expression ``execute a command file'' as
   a shortcut meaning ``execute the commands contained in a command file.''
 
   In interactive mode, execute a command file by using the START command:
 
      START <command file name>;
 
   As a simple example, let the file
 
      lsk_cmd
 
   contain the lines:
 
      ;
      ;  My setup file:
      ;
      LOAD leapseconds.ker;
      DEFINE QUIT EXIT;
      ;
 
   Commands that require interaction, such as EDIT, aren't supported in
   command files.
 
 
Start-up
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Interactive Mode
 
   To run Spy in interactive mode, type the program name (all lower case):
 
      spy
 
   Spy will display a start-up banner followed by the Spy interactive
   command prompt
 
      Spy >
 
   To make Spy execute a command file at start up, specify the command file
   after the -start keyword:
 
      spy -start <command file name>
 
   The command file name may include any needed path specification.
 
   Spy will execute the commands in the file before displaying the command
   prompt. Typically a command file will contain names of kernels to load
   and any symbol definitions used to create command shortcuts.
 
   By default Spy creates a command log file when run in interactive mode.
   Log file creation is disabled using the ``-nolog'' option:
 
      spy -nolog -start <command file name>
 
   In interactive mode, when an input command error is detected, a brief
   diagnostic message will be displayed. Additional information about the
   error can be obtained by typing
 
      ?;
 
   When the detailed error message contains a description of the syntax of
   the expected command, often only a portion of the actual syntax
   description is shown. To see the full syntax of any Spy command, consult
   the syntax diagrams at the end of this document.
 
   Often shortcuts are available to simplify recovery from command errors.
   Spy supports display, editing and re-execution of past commands, so it
   is usually unnecessary to start from scratch when correcting a command
   failure. See the sections below on the RECALL, DO, and EDIT commands for
   details.
 
 
Batch Mode
 
   To run Spy in batch mode, specify the name of a command file following
   the
 
      -start
 
   keyword; Spy will execute the commands in the file and then terminate.
   By default Spy will create a log file. No prompt will be shown. The
   ``-b'' option invokes batch mode:
 
      spy -b -start <command file name>
 
 
Command line mode
 
   In this mode, Spy will optionally execute a specified command file, then
   execute a command typed on the host system command line. This method
   doesn't create a log file; SAVE TO and DISCARD (see Logging below) are
   not supported. Use output redirection to capture results in a file. The
   ``-cl'' option invokes command line mode:
 
      spy -cl -start <command file name> <Spy command>
 
   For example, to see summary and parameter information from an SPK file,
   using the example command file lsk_cmd shown above, you could use the
   command
 
      spy -cl -start lsk_cmd DUMP DATA SPK <SPK file name>
      SUMMARIES PARAMETERS BORDERS
 
   Spy commands entered on the host command line are not terminated with a
   semi-colon. They are continued across lines in the same
   (system-dependent) manner as any other host command.
 
   Some Spy commands executed in command-line mode don't require a set-up
   file because these commands don't perform time conversion or other
   computations dependent on auxiliary loaded kernels. For example, to see
   the file record information from an SPK file, you could use the command
 
      spy -cl DUMP FILE RECORD SPK <SPK file name>
 
   Spy's command-line mode can be convenient for processing multiple files
   using the host command language. For example, on a Unix system, one
   could run Spy's CHECK INTEGRITY command on a set of files having names
   of the form
 
      *.bsp
 
   as follows:
 
      foreach file (*.bsp)
        spy -cl -start lsk_cmd CHECK INTEGRITY SPK $file MESSAGE LIMIT 3
      end
 
 
The RECALL and DO Commands
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The RECALL command displays a short, numbered list of recent commands.
   This list is called the ``command buffer,'' ``command history list,'' or
   the ``history list.'' For example, after entering the commands
 
      set target 5;
      set observer earth;
      sample position frame j2000 aberration correction LT+S
      start time jan 1 2006 stop time jan 1 2007 n 10;
 
   the command
 
      recall;
 
   produces the output
 
      3  set target 5;
      2  set observer earth;
      1  sample position frame j2000 aberration correction LT+S
         start time jan 1 2006 stop time jan 1 2007 n 10;
 
   The most recent command always has index 1. As each new command is
   entered, the indices of buffered commands are incremented.
 
   Any of the commands in the list may be repeated using the DO command.
   For example, the command
 
      do 1;
 
   will execute the SAMPLE command above.
 
   The command serving as the target of a RECALL or DO command may be
   identified by either its integer index in the history list or by an
   initial substring of the first word of the command, if that word is
   sufficient to identify the command. When a substring is used to identify
   the command and the substring matches multiple history list entries, the
   most recent matching command is selected.
 
   Continuing the example above, we can execute the SAMPLE command by
   typing any of
 
      do 1;
      do sample;
      do sam;
      do s;
 
   When a command in the
 
   To re-execute the most recent SET command, we could type either of
 
      do set;
      do 2;
 
   The earlier SET command can only be referenced by its list index:
 
      do 3;
 
   If we simply want to see rather than execute a previous command, we can
   use the reference methods shown above together with the verb RECALL in
   place of DO. Given the command history shown above, for example, the
   command
 
      recall 3;
 
   displays, but does not execute, the command
 
      set target 5;
 
 
The EDIT Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Previous commands can be modified and re-executed using the EDIT
   command. As with the RECALL and DO commands, previous commands to be
   edited may be referenced by command history index or by initial command
   substring. For example, if the RECALL command displays the command
   history
 
      3  load lsk;
      2  set page width 170;
      1  load de405s.bsp;
 
   we can edit the most recent LOAD command by typing
 
      edit load;
 
   We can edit the earlier LOAD command by typing
 
      edit 3;
 
   The EDIT command presents the selected command in an editor buffer,
   where the command text may modified and saved, after which the saved
   command is executed.
 
   The editor may be selected at run time via the SET EDITOR command. For
   example, on a Unix system, to switch from the default vi editor to the
   xemacs editor, type
 
      set editor xemacs;
 
   The selected editor must be specified with sufficient path information
   in order for the host system to run it.
 
   To see the current editor setting, type
 
      show environment;
 
 
Loading and Unloading Kernels
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   To make kernels available for use by Spy, use the LOAD command.
   Typically a leapseconds kernel should be loaded at start-up.
 
      LOAD <kernel>;
 
   You can make Spy unload a kernel using the UNLOAD command:
 
      UNLOAD <kernel>;
 
   In many cases you need to load supporting kernels to enable operation of
   certain SAMPLE, FIND, or CHECK commands. Examples:
 
       --   You may need to load multiple SPK files to define state vectors
            of interest.
 
       --   You will need to load a PCK file to provide body spin sense and
            reference ellipsoid shape data in order to sample states in
            planetographic coordinates.
 
       --   You also may load CK, PCK or FK kernels to define certain
            reference frames. For example, you might load a frame kernel
            defining a view frame for a particular spacecraft.
 
       --   To sample ephemeris information in the form of osculating
            elements, you must load a text kernel containing GM data for
            the central body. The form of the kernel data is
 
               BODYnnn_GM = <value>
 
            where nnn is the NAIF integer ID code of the body and the GM
            value is specified in units of
 
                 3   2
               km / s
 
            For example, the GM for the Earth may be specified as
 
               BODY399_GM = 3.98600436E5
 
   You do not need to load SPK files that are the target of DUMP commands;
   this is because these commands operate on a specific file that is named
   in the command or is identified as a default.
 
 
Managing Default Settings
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Spy maintains several program variables that control Spy's behavior; the
   values of these variables are called Spy's ``default settings.''
 
   Use the SHOW ALL to see the default settings. Loaded kernels are
   included in the display. At start-up, the command
 
      show all;
 
   yields
 
 
       Spy default settings
      ==================================================================
       Aberration Correction:  NONE
       Angular Units        :  DEGREES
       Coordinates          :  RECTANGULAR
       Frame                :  is not set
       N                    :  10
       Number Format        :  1PE15.8
       Observer             :  is not set
       Page Width           :  150
       Reference Body       :  is not set
       SPK                  :  is not set
       Start Time           :  is not set
       Step Size            :  is not set
       Stop Time            :  is not set
       Target               :  is not set
       Time Format          :  YYYY-MON-DD HR:MN:SC.###### (TDB) ::TDB
      ==================================================================
 
   Use
 
      SHOW <item>;
 
   to see only a particular default item.
 
   Use
 
      SET <item>
 
   to change a default value. Examples:
 
      set target moon;
      set observer earth;
      set frame j2000;
      set page width 175;
      set number format E24.16;
      set time format numeric E15.6;
      set step size 1.e3;
      set coordinates geodetic;
      set reference body earth;
      set spk de405s.bsp;
 
   Setting defaults allows you to abbreviate some commands, since Spy will
   use applicable default values when required arguments are omitted from a
   command.
 
   Note that the set of loaded kernels can't be changed by a SET command,
   but you can set the default SPK file so that you don't need to specify
   it by name when using commands such as DUMP DATA that operate on a
   single target SPK file.
 
   Use RESET <item> to set a default to its original value, for example:
 
      reset time format;
 
 
Page Width
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The variable ``PAGE WIDTH'' refers to the number of columns Spy assumes
   are available for formatting its output. By default, Spy's output
   occupies 150 columns. The minimum page width setting Spy supports is 80
   columns.
 
   Spy will automatically wrap outputs to accommodate the specified page
   width.
 
 
Number and Time Formats
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Many Spy commands, such as SAMPLE and DUMP, produce output in the form
   of double precision numbers and time strings. Spy allows you to
   customize the formats of these outputs.
 
 
Number Formats
 
   On output, double precision data can be expressed as formatted floating
   point decimal or hexadecimal numbers. The syntax of a number format
   specification is
 
      NUMBER FORMAT <format string>
 
   Number format specifications may by used to set the default number
   format via the SET NUMBER FORMAT command or as options in other
   commands.
 
   Specify double precision number formats using either Fortran floating
   point formats such as
 
      E15.8
      1PE24.16
      F19.6
 
   or the string
 
      HEX
 
   The latter invokes formatting using SPICELIB hexadecimal scientific
   notation.
 
   Hexadecimal formats allow comparison of outputs at the bit level: if two
   numbers have the same hexadecimal representation (as output by Spy),
   they are identical. Such comparisons are generally not valid when
   decimal formats are used, even when mantissas are displayed to full
   double precision (about 16 digits for IEEE-compliant double precision
   implementations).
 
 
Time Formats
 
   The syntax of an output time format specification is
 
      TIME FORMAT <format string>
 
   Output time format specifications may by used to set the default output
   time format via the SET TIME FORMAT command or as options in other
   commands.
 
   Output time formats can be either string formats supported by the
   SPICELIB routine TIMOUT (timout_c in CSPICE) or numeric formats.
 
   TIMOUT supports a wide variety of formats; we cover just a few examples
   here. See the text below the examples for an explanation of the tokens
   used in the example format strings.
 
   Suppose the time value to be displayed is
 
      2006 Jan 2 03:04:05.678 TDB
 
   Then the following format strings produce the outputs shown:
 
      Format String                        Output
      -------------                        ------

      JULIAND.## JDUTC ::RND               2453737.63 JDUTC
 
   In TIMOUT-style format strings, the following tokens are among those
   recognized and which receive special handling by TIMOUT.
 
      Token        Meaning
      -----        -------
      YYYY         4-digit year

      Wkd          3-letter day of week, first letter capitalized
      .###         3-digit fraction of second or day
      JULIAND      integer portion of Julian date
      ::TDB        Output is expressed in TDB time system
      ::TDT        Output is expressed in TDT (TT) time system
      ::TDB        Output is expressed in UTC time system
      ::RND        Output is to be rounded rather than truncated
 
   The tokens below, which appear in the examples, are not recognized by
   TIMOUT and are simply copied into the output string. These tokens are
   labels which disambiguate the strings:
 
       TDB
       UTC
       JD TDB
       (JD UTC)
       JDUTC
 
   Note that TIMOUT-style string format specifications are case-sensitive
   and must be entered in the exact form expected by TIMOUT. Unrecognized
   tokens will be copied verbatim into output strings. See the header of
   the SPICELIB routine TIMOUT (or the CSPICE routine timout_c) for a
   detailed discussion of supported output formats.
 
   Specify numeric output time formats using the phrase
 
      NUMERIC <number format>
 
   where
 
      <number format>
 
   is one of the numeric formats described in the section ``Number
   Formats'' above.
 
   Numeric formats always display times in the form of seconds past J2000
   TDB. Use TIMOUT-style formats such as those shown above to obtain Julian
   date output formats.
 
   Spy's allowed input time formats are those supported by the SPICELIB
   routine STR2ET (str2et_c in CSPICE). Because input time strings must be
   unambiguous, the set of supported input formats is not nearly as large
   as the set of supported output formats. Below are a few examples of
   recognized strings:
 
      String                         Time string is interpreted as
      ------                         -----------------------------
      2006 JAN 2 03:04:05.678 TDB    TDB calendar date
      jan 2 2006 03:04:05.678 tdt    TDT calendar date
      01/02/2006 03:03:00.494 UTC    UTC calendar date
      01/02/2006 03:03:00.494        UTC calendar date
      2453737.62784350  jd Tdb       TDB Julian date
      2453737.62784350 JD utc        UTC Julian date
      2453737.6                      UTC Julian date
 
   Time string inputs, unlike output time formats, are case-insensitive.
   See the header of the SPICELIB routine STR2ET (or the CSPICE routine
   str2et_c) for a detailed discussion of supported input formats.
 
 
Body names and IDs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In general, bodies (ephemeris objects) may be identified in Spy commands
   by either their names or their integer ID codes. Body names are
   case-insensitive. For example, Jupiter may be identified by the strings
   'JUPITER' or 'jupiter', or by the ID code 599.
 
   Spy supports body names containing up to five words separated by blanks.
   Bodies whose names contain more than five words must be specified by
   integer ID codes.
 
   Additional name-ID associations may be introduced to Spy at run time by
   loading a text kernel containing the associations. See the NAIF_IDS
   Required Reading for further information.
 
 
Logging
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In modes other than command-line, Spy will create a command log by
   default. Use the keyword -nolog at start-up to disable command logging:
 
      spy -nolog
 
   Spy will attempt to create the command log in the current working
   directory. If a log file cannot be opened due to inadequate user
   permissions, Spy will display an error message and continue running.
 
   To save results to a specified file while continuing to send results to
   the standard output stream, use the command
 
      save to <file>;
 
   You can only save to one file at a time; a second SAVE command will cut
   off output to the previous SAVE file.
 
   To command Spy to discontinue saving results to the file, type
 
      discard;
 
 
Shut-down
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   To exit Spy gracefully, type
 
      EXIT;
 
   If you prefer to use an alternative command such as the verb ``quit''
   you can define that verb as a symbol in your start-up file:
 
      DEFINE QUIT EXIT;
 
   To kill Spy immediately, type the host system interrupt command, for
   example ``Control C.''
 
   Note that the Unix command ``Control D'' is not recognized by Spy.
 
 
Sampling Ephemeris Data
===========================================================================
 
 
The SAMPLE Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The SAMPLE command allows you to see a time-tagged list of evaluated
   states or other ephemeris data. Like the SPICE SPK system's subroutine
   API, the SAMPLE command can draw on data from multiple loaded SPK files
   or other kernels.
 
   The basic form of the SAMPLE command is
 
      SAMPLE <ephemeris item> <parameters>
 
   Here the ephemeris item may be any of
 
      ACCELERATION (obtained via numerical differentiation)
      ACCELERATION MAGNITUDE (magnitude of derived acceleration)
      DISTANCE
      DERIVED SPEED (magnitude of derived velocity)
      DERIVED VELOCITY (obtained via numerical differentiation)
      ELEMENTS
      POSITION
      SPEED
      STATE
      VELOCITY
 
   The quantities ACCELERATION and DERIVED VELOCITY are obtained via
   numerical differentiation; ACCELERATION MAGNITUDE and DERIVED SPEED are
   the respective magnitudes of the former quantities.
 
   Derived velocity can be compared to velocity obtained directly from the
   SPICE SPK system (via the SAMPLE VELOCITY command) to identify
   mathematical inconsistencies between an SPK file's position and velocity
   data.
 
   Sampled data are expressed in the units
 
                    2                              2
      km, km/s, km/s, degrees, degrees/s, degrees/s
 
   Angular units may be reset to any units supported by the SPICELIB
   routine CONVRT (convrt_c in CSPICE). Length and time units are not
   adjustable.
 
   The parameters may be set within the command or may be supplied as
   defaults. Parameters specified in a command override default values. The
   minimum parameter set that must be provided is
 
      START TIME <time string>
      STOP TIME <time string>
      STEP SIZE <d.p. number of seconds>
      N <sample count>
      FRAME <reference frame name>
      OBSERVER <observer name>
      TARGET <target name>
 
   Only one of the parameter settings
 
      STEP SIZE <d.p. number of seconds>
      N <sample count>
 
   should be used in the command. When a step size is used, the sampling
   times are separated by the indicated step; the first sample is taken at
   the start time. When a sample count greater than 1 is specified, that
   number of samples are taken at evenly spaced intervals; the sample times
   range from the specified start and stop times, inclusive. When the
   sample count is 1, the sample is taken at the start time.
 
   All SAMPLE parameters other than those listed above have defaults. (In
   the case of aberration correction you should reset the default or
   specify a value as needed.) The full set of additional parameters is
 
      ABERRATION CORRECTION <string>
      ANGULAR UNITS <units>
      COORDINATES <coordinate system>
      DELTAS
      INDICES
      NUMBER FORMAT <format>
      TIME FORMAT <format>
      REFERENCE BODY <body name or ID>
 
   The keyword DELTAS indicates that differences of successive values,
   rather than the values themselves, should be displayed.
 
   The keyword INDICES indicates that sample indices should be displayed in
   the first column.
 
   The supported coordinate systems are
 
      CYLINDRICAL
      GEODETIC
      LATITUDINAL
      PLANETOGRAPHIC
      RECTANGULAR
      SPHERICAL
 
   For planetographic and geodetic coordinates, a reference body must be
   specified (via the REFERENCE BODY parameter). For coordinate systems
   having angular coordinates, the ANGULAR UNITS parameter may be used.
 
   The default coordinate system is RECTANGULAR. For rectangular
   coordinates, the order of the state outputs is
 
      X  Y  Z  dX/dt dY/dt dZ/dt
 
   For the other systems, the order follows that of the outputs of the
   corresponding SPICELIB (or CSPICE) coordinate conversion routine.
   Specifically, for latitudinal coordinates, the order is
 
      radius(r) longitude(lon) latitude(lat) d(r)/dt d(lon)/dt d(lat)/dt
 
   For spherical coordinates:
 
      radius(r) colatitude(colat) longitude(lon) d(r)/dt d(colat)/dt
      d(lon)/dt
 
   For cylindrical coordinates:
 
      radius(r) longitude(lon) Z  d(r)/dt d(lon)/dt d(Z)/dt
 
   For geodetic coordinates (this term is also used for bodies other than
   the earth):
 
      longitude(lon) latitude(lat) altitude(alt) d(lon)/dt d(lat)/dt
      d(alt)/dt
 
   For planetographic coordinates:
 
      longitude(lon) latitude(lat) altitude(alt) d(lon)/dt d(lat)/dt
      d(alt)/dt
 
 
SAMPLE Command Examples
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Below we show the outputs produced by various SAMPLE commands.
 
   Note: the format of the output shown here is not representative of what
   would be seen in a normal interactive session because the format of this
   document allows a maximum page width of just 66 columns for
   illustrations. In some of the examples below, we've used a combination
   of custom number and time formats as well as artificial wrapping of
   results to fit the illustrations into the available space. The custom
   format specifications used as command arguments can be omitted in
   practice.
 
 
Basic State Vector Lookup
 
   Here we sample geometric states of the Moon as seen from the Earth. We
   load kernels, then execute a SAMPLE command. We use an 80-column page
   width, so the output lines containing the state data are wrapped. We
   modify the time format to make the output actually fit in 66 columns.
 
   Normally each state and its corresponding time tag would be written on a
   single line.
 
   After executing the setup commands
 
      load leapseconds.ker;
      load de405.bsp;
      set page width 80;
 
   the command
 
      sample states
      observer earth
      target moon
      frame J2000
      aberration correction none
      time format YYYY-MON-DD HR:MN:SC.#### (TDB) ::TDB
      step size 10
      start time jan 1 2006 00:00:00 TDB
      stop time jan 1 2007 00:00:40 TDB;
 
   produces the output

   In the interest of readability, we repeat the above example with a few
   changes: we sample position only, and we use a numeric time format to
   save space. The query is:
 
      sample position
      observer earth
      target moon

      aberration correction none

   Since our time step is relatively small, we can compare these results to
   those we'd obtain by sampling velocity directly. The deltas (other than
   the first) should have magnitudes approximately 10 times those of the
   corresponding velocity values. The command
 
      sample velocity
      observer earth
      target moon
      frame J2000
      aberration correction none
      start time jan 1 2006 00:00:00 TDB

Sampling Osculating Elements
 
   In order to sample osculating elements, we must load a text kernel
   providing the GM of the observer, which is always considered to be the
   central body. We also must use an inertial reference frame (or a frame
   that rotates very slowly) in order for the elements to be sensible.
 
   We repeat the state lookup of the Moon relative to the Earth, this time
   expressing the states as elements. First we load the required gravity
   data:
 
      load /ftp/pub/naif/generic_kernels/pck/de-403-masses.tpc;
 
   Next we issue the sample command:
 
      sample elements
      observer earth
      target moon
      frame J2000
      aberration correction none
      start time jan 1 2006 00:00:00 TDB
      stop time jan 1 2006 00:00:40 TDB
      step size 10
      time format numeric 1PE15.8;

Varying the Coordinate System
 
   Here we sample states of Titan relative to Saturn using the command file
   ``sam.cmd'' which contains:
 
      load lsk;
      load sat252.bsp;
      load de405s.bsp;
      load pck00008.tpc;
      set observer saturn;
      set target titan;
      set frame iau_saturn;
      set reference body saturn;
      set aberration correction none;
      set start time jan 1 2007 TDB;
      set stop time jan 2 2007 TDB;
      set page width 80;
      set time format numeric E15.8;
      set number format E15.8;
      set n 2;
      sample states;
      sample states coordinates latitudinal;
      sample states coordinates geodetic reference body saturn;
      sample states coordinates planetographic reference body saturn;
      sample states coordinates spherical;
      sample states coordinates cylindrical;
 
   In this file, ``lsk'' refers to a leapseconds kernel; ``sat252.bsp'' is
   a Saturn satellite ephemeris.
 
   We've used a numeric time format and we've set the page width to 80
   columns to save space.
 
   Instead of setting a step size, we've used a sample count: the command
 
      set n 2;
 
   requests two samples for each SAMPLE command; this produces two state
   outputs in each of the six specified coordinate systems.
 
   We execute the command file as follows:
 
      Spy > start sam.cmd;
 
   The output created by this command file is:

Dumping SPK Contents
===========================================================================
 
   ``Dumping'' refers to display of file contents, as opposed to evaluated
   quantities such as state vectors.
 
   The supported kinds of SPK file dumps are
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> <parameters>
      DUMP COVERAGE SPK <file> <parameters>
      DUMP COMMENTS SPK <file name>
      DUMP FILE RECORD SPK <file name>
      DUMP LINKS SPK <file name>
      DUMP ADDRESS RANGE SPK <file name> <parameters>
 
   DUMP commands always act on a single, specified SPK file. The file may
   be identified as the default using the SET SPK command.
 
 
The DUMP DATA Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The DUMP DATA command displays contents of SPK segments, along with
   their associated descriptors and segment identifiers.
 
 
Restricting Output
 
   Because SPK files often contain a great deal of data, it's usually
   advisable to specify constraints to limit the set of data to be
   displayed. The DUMP DATA command supports constraints on segments,
   packets, time intervals, and bodies.
 
   The segment selection parameters are:
 
      SEGMENT INDEX <integer>
      START SEGMENT <integer>
      STOP SEGMENT <integer>
 
   ``Packets'' are time-tagged data sets such as state vectors, two-line
   element sets, or Chebyshev coefficient sets. The packet selection
   parameters are:
 
      PACKET INDEX <integer>
      START PACKET START <integer>
      STOP PACKET <integer>
 
   Packet range specifiers apply only to packet-oriented SPK data types;
   these specifiers are ignored for other data types. Currently (as of
   December 2006) all SPK data types are packet-oriented except for types
   15 and 17.
 
   Time bounds are specified as for the SAMPLE command:
 
      START TIME <time string>
      STOP TIME <time string>
 
   Bodies are selected by name or NAIF ID code:
 
      BODIES <list of names or IDs>
 
   The body specifications are separated by commas.
 
   NAIF IDs of spacecraft are usually negative numbers. See the NAIF_IDS
   Required Reading or Tutorial for details concerning ID code conventions
   and built-in name-ID associations.
 
   When no body list is supplied, all bodies are considered for dumping.
 
   All of the constraints shown above operate in conjunction with each
   other: the selected data must satisfy all provided constraints.
 
   Example: show only the first three packets of each segment for body
   Jupiter, in SPK file de405.bsp:
 
      DUMP DATA SPK de405.bsp STOP PACKET 3 BODIES JUPITER;
 
 
Selecting Display Components
 
   The keywords for the components of a DUMP DATA display are:
 
      ADDRESSES
      BORDERS
      DIRECTORIES
      EPOCHS
      FULL
      INDICES
      LEGENDS
      METADATA
      PACKETS
      PARAMETERS
      SUMMARIES
 
   By default, a DUMP DATA command shows these components:
 
      BORDERS
      EPOCHS
      INDICES
      LEGENDS
      PACKETS
      PARAMETERS
      SUMMARIES
 
   The default display includes horizontal borders and packet indices, for
   readability, as well as a legend describing packet layout.
 
   The full set of components includes bookkeeping data and DAF address
   labels. The full display is invoked by adding the keyword
 
      FULL
 
   to a DUMP DATA command.
 
   One can also select any subset of components. For example, to see only
   segment summaries (and horizontal display separators), use the command
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> BORDERS SUMMARIES;
 
   The keyword METADATA applies to generic segment metadata (not
   descriptive comments). These data are found only in type 10 and type 14
   segments.
 
 
Using Reference Values
 
   Time tags can be displayed as offsets from a specified reference epoch;
   to do this add the phrase
 
      REFERENCE TIME <epoch specifier>
 
   to a DUMP DATA command. Here
 
      <epoch specifier>
 
   can be any of
 
      DESCRIPTOR BEGIN
      DESCRIPTOR END
      <time string>
      INDEX: <integer>
 
   To use this feature, the output time format setting must be numeric.
 
   For example, the command
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> REFERENCE TIME INDEX:3
      TIME FORMAT NUMERIC E15.8
      SEGMENT INDEX 2;
 
   will show, in place of each time tag, the difference between that tag
   and the time tag of the third packet of the second segment.
 
   Packet contents also can be displayed as offsets from a specified
   packet; to do this, add the phrase
 
      REFERENCE PACKET <integer>
 
   to a DUMP DATA command.
 
   For example, the command
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> REFERENCE PACKET 3
      SEGMENT INDEX 2;
 
   will show, in place of each packet element, the difference between that
   element and the corresponding element of the third packet of the second
   segment.
 
   Reference times and packets may be used together or separately.
 
   Reference specifiers apply only to packet-oriented SPK data types; these
   specifiers are ignored for other data types.
 
 
Using Delta Values
 
   Time tags and packets also can be displayed as ``deltas'': differences
   from their predecessors. Add the phrase
 
      EPOCH DELTAS
 
   to a DUMP command to show time tag differences.
 
   The output time format setting must be numeric to use this feature.
 
   For example, the command
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> EPOCH DELTAS SEGMENT INDEX 3
      TIME FORMAT NUMERIC 1PE15.8;
 
   will show the time tags of the third segment with the first tag equal to
   zero, the second tag equal to the difference of the actual second tag
   and the first, and so on.
 
   For commands where specific display components are listed, such as
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> BORDERS
      SUMMARIES PACKETS EPOCHS;
 
   The phrase
 
      EPOCH DELTAS
 
   must be added; it doesn't replace the token
 
      EPOCHS
 
   So to modify the above command to show epoch deltas, one would type
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> BORDERS
      SUMMARIES PACKETS EPOCHS EPOCH DELTAS;
 
   Add the phrase
 
      PACKET DELTAS
 
   to a DUMP command to show packet differences. Each element is shown as
   the difference of its actual value and the value of the corresponding
   element of the preceding packet.
 
   For example, the command
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> PACKET DELTAS SEGMENT INDEX 3;
 
   will show the packets of the third segment with all entries of the first
   packet equal to zero, those of the second packet equal to the difference
   of their actual values and those of the corresponding elements of the
   first packet, and so on.
 
   For commands where specific display components are listed, such as
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> BORDERS
      SUMMARIES PACKETS EPOCHS;
 
   The phrase
 
      PACKET DELTAS
 
   must be added; it doesn't replace the token
 
      PACKETS
 
   So to modify the above command to show packet deltas, one would type
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> BORDERS
      SUMMARIES PACKETS EPOCHS PACKET DELTAS;
 
   Epoch and packet delta specifiers apply only to packet-oriented SPK data
   types; these specifiers are ignored for other data types.
 
 
Specifying a Non-native Reference Frame
 
   As a convenience, segment data may optionally be displayed in a
   reference frame other than that associated with the segment. To do this
   use the phrase
 
      FRAME <frame name>
 
   in the command.
 
   This command is only applicable to SPK data types that use a vector
   representation of ephemeris data: types 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 18.
 
   Example:
 
      DUMP DATA SPK <file name> FRAME ECLIPJ2000;

   expressing the packet contents as differences from the values contained
   in a specified packet. For example, we'll dump packets 10 through 15
   from segment 500, using packet 12 as a reference packet. We'll limit the
   displayed components to borders, epochs, and packets. The command
 
      dump data spk

      CONCLUSION
 
      DE405 represents the most accurate planetary positions available.
      Certainly, they are not perfect; extrapolation forward or backward
       in time
      will always show some amount of deterioration. Subsequent improvem
      ents
      will continue with further acquisition of observational measuremen
      ts.

The DUMP ADDRESS RANGE Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The DUMP ADDRESS RANGE command shows the contents of a specified range
   of DAF addresses in a specified SPK file. The syntax is:
 
      DUMP ADDRESS RANGE SPK <file name> <range specification>
                             <integer flag> <number format>
 
   Here
 
      <range specification>
 
   may be either or both of
 
      START <integer>
      STOP <integer>
 
   The integer flag indicates that each dumped number should be expressed
   both as a double precision number and an array of two integers related
   by Fortran EQUIVALENCE to the double precision value. This flag is
 
      INTEGERS
 
   The number format is applied to all output numbers, including integers.
   This format specification is identical to that used for the SET command.
 
   This command treats the specified range as a sequence of double
   precision numbers. The user must ensure that this assumption is true for
   the specified address range. It is safe to dump subsets of the address
   range given by a segment descriptor (presuming the file in question is
   not corrupted).
 
   Summary (descriptor) records contain some double precision data and some
   pairs of integers packed into double precision values via Fortran
   EQUIVALENCE. Contents of descriptor records are best viewed using the
   INTEGERS flag. Note that the packed integer values are
   platform-dependent.
 
   Address ranges that span the file record, comment area, or name records
   contain bit patterns that are not meaningful when expressed as double
   precision numbers.
 
 
DUMP ADDRESS RANGE Example
 
   We'll look at the contents of a segment descriptor (aka a ``segment
   summary'') from the planetary SPK file
 
      de405s.bsp
 
   First we'll use a DUMP DATA command to view the descriptor for the
   second segment in the file:
 
      dump data spk de405s.bsp
      segment index 2
      summaries addresses borders
      time format numeric 1PE15.8;
 
   This yields
 
      Dump of SPK File de405s.bsp
      ==================================================================
      Segment number 2
      ------------------------------
      Segment Summary:
 
       Segment ID       : DE-405
       Target Body      : Body 2, VENUS BARYCENTER
       Center Body      : Body 0, SOLAR SYSTEM BARYCENTER
       Reference Frame  : Frame 1, J2000
       SPK Data Type    : Type 2
          Description   : Fixed Width, Fixed Order Chebyshev Polynomials

       UTC Start Time   : 1997 JAN 01 00:00:00.000
       UTC Stop Time    : 2010 JAN 01 23:59:58.000
       ET Start Time    : -9.46511378E+07
       ET Stop Time     : 3.15662463E+08
       DAF Begin Address: 27165
       DAF End Address  : 36672
 
       Descriptor DAF address range is         777:781
       Segment identifier DAF address range is 905:909
      ==================================================================
 
   Next we issue a DUMP ADDRESS RANGE command to dump the address range
   occupied by the segment descriptor. We use the INTEGERS option to show
   the contents of each descriptor element as pairs of integers, in
   addition to the default display, which treats each element as a double
   precision number.
 
      dump address range spk de405s.bsp
      start 777 stop 781 integers;
 
   This yields

      ==================================================================
 
   The first two double precision values (at addresses 777 and 778) should
   match the descriptor time bounds. The last six integer values (at
   addresses 779 through 781) should match, respectively, the segment's
   body, center, frame ID code, data type, and start and end DAF addresses.
   Comparison with the segment descriptor displayed previously confirms the
   match.
 
 
Searching for Geometric Events
===========================================================================
 
   Spy enables you to find time windows when certain geometric events
   occur.
 
 
The FIND Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The geometric event search commands supported by Spy are:
 
      FIND DISTANCE <relation> <parameters>
      FIND ELEVATION <relation> <parameters>
 
   The relations supported are:
 
      ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM
      ABSOLUTE MINIMUM
      LOCAL MAXIMUM
      LOCAL MINIMUM
      EQ <d.p. value> <optional units>
      GT <d.p. value> <optional units>
      LT <d.p. value> <optional units>
 
   Required parameters for both search types are
 
      ABERRATION CORRECTION <string>
      OBSERVER <observer name or ID>
      START TIME <time string>
      STEP SIZE <d.p. number of seconds>
      STOP TIME <time string>
      TARGET <target name or ID>
 
   In addition, the FIND ELEVATION command requires the parameter
 
      FRAME <reference frame name>
 
   The choice of step size is critical for effective searching. The step
   size must be small enough so that at most one instance of the event of
   interest occurs within any interval whose length equals the step size.
   The step size must be large enough so that the search completes in a
   reasonable time.
 
   The search algorithm works well with smooth, well-behaved functions. It
   should not be expected to work with pathological functions such as a
   perfect step function.
 
   As an example of an event search, find the closest approach of the Moon
   to the Earth during a specified time interval, using geometric (without
   aberration corrections) position data.

      ==================================================================
 
   When the observer is a site on the Earth's surface, for example a DSN
   station, and the reference frame is a topocentric frame centered at the
   site, the FIND ELEVATION command can be used to find approximate view
   periods for a specified target. High-precision binary PCKs should be
   loaded in order to conduct such a search. Note that tropospheric
   effects, which may be significant, are not modeled in this computation.
   Also, constraints such as cable wrap limits or other physical antenna
   pointing limitations are not addressed by this type of search.
 
 
Validating SPK files
===========================================================================
 
   Spy's CHECK commands perform a variety of SPK validation functions.
 
   Spy can perform structural and low-level semantic checks automatically.
   These built-in checks can identify improperly constructed files but do
   not address the issue of whether an ephemeris ``makes sense.''
 
   All other validation functions require user inputs to specify how checks
   are to be performed. For example, checking that evaluated ephemeris data
   lie in expected numeric ranges requires user-supplied specifications of
   the times at which the ephemeris is to be sampled, the specific
   quantities to be checked, and the interval within which the data are
   expected to lie.
 
 
The CHECK INTEGRITY Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The CHECK INTEGRITY command inspects a specified SPK file and indicates
   whether any structural or basic semantic errors are detected.
 
   The CHECK INTEGRITY command has the form
 
      CHECK INTEGRITY SPK <file name>     <epoch spacing constraints>
                          <number format> <time format>
                          <silent flag>   <message limit>
 
   The optional epoch spacing constraints cause Spy to flag epochs that
   violate the constraints. The constraints may indicate minimum and
   maximum spacing limits, as well as a bound on the maximum ratio of
   lengths of consecutive intervals between epochs. The syntax for the
   constraints is:
 
      MIN     EPOCH SPACING <number>
      MINIMUM EPOCH SPACING <number>
      MAX     EPOCH SPACING <number>
      MAXIMUM EPOCH SPACING <number>
      MAX     SPACING RATIO <number>
      MAXIMUM SPACING RATIO <number>
 
   These limits only apply to packet-oriented segments; for other segments
   the limits are ignored.
 
   The number and time format specifiers follow the same syntax as those
   used in the SET command.
 
   The silent flag, when set, causes Spy to abort if any condition
   resulting in a warning or error is found. When Spy aborts, it returns an
   ``error'' exit code, if this feature is supported on the host platform.
   This feature is intended for use in command line mode. The token for
   silent operation is
 
      SILENT
 
   The optional message limit indicates the maximum number of
   informational, warning, or error messages to be displayed.
 
   Example: run default checks on a specified SPK file; flag any epochs
   separated by less than a millisecond, and display no more than three
   diagnostics.
 
      check integrity spk de405.bsp min epoch spacing 1.e-3
      error limit 3;
 
 
CHECK INTEGRITY Examples
 
   First, check a file known to be valid:
 
      check integrity spk de405s.bsp;
 
   This yields:
 
      Structure Inspection of SPK File de405s.bsp
      ==================================================================
      No error diagnostics and no warnings generated for SPK file de405s
      .bsp
      ==================================================================
 
   Next, check a file that has a structural problem:
 
      check integrity
      spk /ftp/pub/naif/GLL/misc/NIMS/030707/GLL920514.BSP;
 
   This yields the diagnostic output

The CHECK BOUNDS Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The CHECK BOUNDS command finds times when magnitudes or components of
   specified ephemeris quantities exceed specified limits.
 
   The CHECK BOUNDS command has the forms
 
      CHECK BOUNDS LOWER <value> <quantity specification>;
      CHECK BOUNDS UPPER <value> <quantity specification>;
      CHECK BOUNDS LOWER <value> UPPER <value> <quantity specification>;
 
   or
 
      CHECK BOUNDS LOWER <value> COMPONENT <integer> <quantity
      specification>;
 
      CHECK BOUNDS UPPER <value> COMPONENT <integer> <quantity
      specification>;
 
      CHECK BOUNDS LOWER <value> UPPER <value> COMPONENT <integer>
      <quantity specification>;
 
   Quantity specifications are just like those of the SAMPLE command.
 
   When the checked quantity is a vector, its magnitude is used in the
   comparisons.
 
   Example (set-up not shown):
 
      check bounds upper 5.65e-4 acceleration
      observer earth target smart-1
      start time sep 2 2006
      stop time sep 3 2006
      step size 60
      frame J2000
      aberration correction none;
 
 
CHECK BOUNDS Examples
 
   We sample the magnitude of the geometric acceleration the Moon relative
   to the Earth over a time interval of 30 days and flag any samples where
   the magnitude exceeds
 
                  2
      3.08e-6 km/s
 
   We first load a leapseconds kernel and a planetary SPK file:
 
      load lsk;
      load de405s.bsp;
 
   Now perform the check. We display the indices as well as the sample
   times of the values that exceed the limit.
 
      check bounds upper 3.08e-6 acceleration magnitude
      observer earth
      target moon
      frame J2000

      start time 2006 nov 1 TDB
      stop time 2006 dec 1 TDB
      indices
      n 1000;

   Next, we check the x-component of acceleration. In this example, we
   check for the x-component taking values below
 
                     2
      -3.068e-06 km/s
 
   We adjust the number format to make the output fit in our narrow page.
   The command is:

The CHECK ADDRESS RANGE Command
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The CHECK ADDRESS RANGE command inspects a specified range of DAF
   addresses and indicates whether any invalid bit patterns are detected.
 
   Spy checks only the portion of the specified address range that lies
   within data regions of SPK segments. The file record, comment area,
   descriptor records, and name records are not checked.
 
   The CHECK ADDRESS RANGE command has the form
 
      CHECK ADDRESS RANGE SPK <file name> <start address> <stop address>
                              <bit display specification> <error limit>
 
   The start and stop address specifications have the form
 
      START <integer>
      STOP <integer>
 
   If either bound is omitted, the bounds default to the first and last
   address of the file, respectively.
 
   The optional bit display specification indicates whether a pictorial
   representation of invalid bit patterns is to be displayed. The bit
   display specification consists of the token
 
      BITS
 
   The optional error limit indicates the maximum number of error messages
   to be displayed. The error limit syntax is
 
      ERROR LIMIT <integer>
 
   Example: check the first 100000 d.p. numbers of the SPK file de405s.bsp,
   displaying showing no more than three error messages:
 
      check address range spk de405.bsp
      start 1 stop 100000 bits error limit 3;
 
 
CHECK ADDRESS RANGE Examples
 
   First, we check a file known to be valid:
 
      check address range spk de405s.bsp
 
   Since we omitted start and stop values, the entire file will be checked.
   The resulting output is:
 
      Checking D.P. Numbers in SPK File de405s.bsp
      ==================================================================
       No invalid double precision values were found.
      ==================================================================
 
   Next we check a file into which invalid bit patterns have been inserted.
   We ask for a display of any invalid bit patterns found.
 
      check address range spk poke.bsp bits;
 
   This yields
 
      Checking D.P. Numbers in SPK File poke.bsp
      ==================================================================
       Address 385:                SUBNORMAL
          0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
      00 0000 0000 0000
       Address 387:                SUBNORMAL
          0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
      00 0000 0000 0000
       Address 39293:              -INFINITY
          1111 1111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
      00 0000 0000 0000
      ------------------------------
       3 invalid double precision values were found.
      ==================================================================
 
   Note that the bit pattern display is always big-endian, regardless of
   the binary format of the checked file.
 
 
Spy Command Syntax
===========================================================================
 
 
Meta/2 Syntax Description Language
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Spy's command language is word-oriented. The words in a command must
   match a pattern called the ``syntax'' of the command. The syntax of each
   of Spy's commands can be expressed in a language called Meta/2, which
   was developed by NAIF. The sections below describe the various
   constructs that make up a Meta/2 syntax specification.
 
 
Keywords
 
   Every Spy command begins with a keyword. Keywords define the structure
   of a command: for the most part, a command is a collection of keywords,
   some of which are associated with non-keyword arguments. The keywords of
   a Meta/2 syntax description are the words that do not begin with one of
   the special characters in the list below:
 
      "("   the left parenthesis
      "@"   the "at" sign
      "|"   the vertical bar
      "}"    the right  brace
 
   The simplest Meta/2 expressions consist entirely of keywords. Some of
   Spy's commands that fall into this category are shown below.
 
      SHOW KERNELS;
      SET COORDINATES LATITUDINAL;
      RESET NUMBER FORMAT;
 
   When you type a command, you may enter the keywords in upper, lower or
   mixed case.
 
 
Class Templates
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Keywords can be associated with non-keyword values. The values
   associated with a keyword always immediately follow that keyword. A
   collection of values is terminated by another keyword, or by the end of
   the command.
 
   Class templates are used to indicate that the values associated with a
   particular keyword belong to a class of values. For example the Meta/2
   expression of the rule that the keyword SPK is to be followed by a file
   name looks like this:
 
      SPK @word ...
 
   The symbol ``@word'' indicates that the next word in the command
   following the keyword SPK should be a sequence of contiguous, printable,
   non-white-space characters.
 
 
number
 
   The template ``@number'' matches any number. Examples are
 
      1
      3.14
      0.07281D-10
 
 
int
 
   The template ``@int'' matches only integer values. Examples are
 
      -3
      26172771
      0.24E6
 
 
word
 
   The template ``@word'' matches any string of contiguous, non-blank,
   printing characters. Examples are
 
      alpine
      /u/user/naif/etc/data/spam
      ^&HANNk228***(JASNSK
 
 
name
 
   The template @name matches any word that begins with a letter and
   contains from one to 32 letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
   Examples are
 
      Andrea
      BRORSEN-METCALF
      COMMAND_STEM
      X11J9
 
 
calendar
 
   The template ``@calendar'' matches a sequence of words that make up a
   calendar date. The rules for matching this template are somewhat
   complicated: for the most part, any unambiguous format will be accepted.
   Examples are
 
      JAN 1, 1992 12:28:28
      1992-3-18 18:28
      5 APR 1993 18:00:00.289
      12-1-1995
      Nov 30 2006 18:00:05.234 TDB
 
   All formats accepted by the SPICELIB (CSPICE) routine STR2ET (str2et_c)
   may be used to express calendar dates.
 
 
Template Quantifiers
 
   The construct
 
      TIME FORMAT (1:10)@word
 
   matches the keywords TIME FORMAT followed by between one and ten words.
   The quantifier
 
      (n:m)
 
   when prefixed to any class template has similar meaning. The lower bound
   is always present, and is always positive. The upper bound is optional:
   for example, template
 
      (2:)@int
 
   matches any sequence of two or more integer words.
 
 
Numeric Qualifiers
 
   The construct
 
      START PACKET @int(8:80)
 
   matches the keywords START PACKET followed by an integer between 8 and
   80 inclusive. The qualifier
 
      (n:m)
 
   when suffixed to any numeric class template has similar meaning. Both
   bounds are optional: for example the templates
 
      @number(2:)
      @number(:1000)
 
   are matched by numeric words whose values are greater than or equal to
   two and less than or equal to 1000 respectively.
 
 
Character Qualifiers
 
   The construct
 
      DIRECTORY @word([*]|*%:[*]|*:)
 
   matches any word that matches one of the individual wildcard templates
 
      [*]
 
      *%:[*]
 
      *:
 
   The wildcard characters (asterisk and percent sign) match any substring
   and any character respectively. The qualifier
 
      (t1|...|tn)
 
   when suffixed to any character class template has a similar meaning.
 
 
Combining Quantifiers with Qualifiers
 
   Quantifiers and qualifiers may be combined in any combination. The
   following are all valid class templates.
 
      @int(-5:5)
 
      (3:)@name(A*|B*|*X)
 
      (1:3)@name(John|Bobby|Teddy)
 
 
Switches
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The construct
 
         (0:4){     START @int(1:)
                  | STOP @int(1:)
                  | ERROR LIMIT @int(1:)
                  | BITS                   }
 
   is called a switch. It is the final construct that you need to know.
   Although it looks forbidding, it is really quite simple. A switch is a
   list of keyword-template phrases, separated by vertical bars, and
   surrounded by braces. The left brace is prefixed with a quantifier,
 
         (n:m){ ... }
 
   Whenever you see a switch, it means that at least n and not more than m
   of the phrases separated by vertical bars must appear; however, they may
   appear in any order. Thus, the syntax
 
         (0:4){     START @int(1:)
                  | STOP @int(1:)
                  | ERROR LIMIT @int(1:)
                  | BITS                   }
 
   matches all of the following sequences of words:
 
      START 1 STOP 100
      STOP 100 BITS START 1 ERROR LIMIT 3
      STOP 100 BITS
      ERROR LIMIT 3 BITS
      BITS
      <empty sequence>
 
 
Nesting Switches
 
   Switches cannot be nested. The construct
 
         (a:b){ ...
              | (c:d){ ...  }
              }
 
   is illegal.
 
 
Spy Command Syntax Diagrams
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The diagrams below are Meta/2 syntax descriptions. These descriptions
   specify patterns that valid commands must match. However, these
   descriptions do not completely specify the Spy command language, because
   some elements of Spy's command language, such as number and time
   formats, don't lend themselves to concise descriptions in the Meta/2
   language.
